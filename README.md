### Why I create this:
   * We are all FWSA batch 2 students. After 300 days we have an interview for our internship. At that time, the interviewer will review our github  link, portfolio and also see our final project. The Interviewer will see all these things in my website. It can be easy to see and itâ€™s helpful for our Freshworks software academy and also helpful for the next batch. The two things that I want to proudly do are create a website for FWSA and the interviewer should use my website to review our projects.

### Gem used in my project

   * Ransack - Search capability in a Ruby on Rails application.
   * rubocop - Static code analysis of the ruby codebase.

### What is freshports?
   * freshports is a portfolio management software.
   * It is based on our academy portfolio.
   * This can be used by both students(users) and the coaches(users).
   * Students will be able to see  their portfolio and also create their portfolio.
   * Coaches will be able to do the add their own portfolio and  students portfolio.
   * Admins only delete the portfolio.

### Name reason
   * fresh + ports(means portfolio)
   
### Our motive
   * Portfolios are everything, promises are nothing. Do the work

### Libraries
   * Active Storage - Facilitates uploading files to a cloud storage service and attaching those files to Active Record objects.

### My future plan
   * In my project admin only edit the staff and student page, but they wants to change their profile.
   * So they need to send the query to the admin for that I will create a query box in which the user can send the message to the admin regarding changes
